        Working in finance, I always had a keen interest in technology. About a year ago, I took a chance and started learning programming. I took a course that taught me web development basics like <span className="font-medium">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js</span>. I also independently learned <span className="font-medium">TypeScript</span> and use it extensively in my projects, along with <span className="font-medium">Next.js</span>. I enjoy exploring various libraries to find the most suitable solutions. Knowing there are many more to discover, I`m excited about the opportunities ahead. What excites me most about programming is taking on tough challenges and eventually finding solutions.

        Outside of work, I love being outdoors. I enjoy activities like biking, yoga, and swimming. I`m a big fan of traveling, camping, and finding peaceful places in nature. One of my big dreams is to see the southern lights in Iceland, even if it`s a bit of a clich√©!

        Right now, I`m searching for a <span className="font-medium italic">full-time position of junior developer</span> where I can apply my skills to real projects and keep growing.
